As they get older, that exposure grows every day, thanks to the widespread use of smartphones, laptops and other wireless devices in the classroom and at home.\\n\\nWireless devices radiate radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. Research has raised concerns about the health risks of exposure to this radiation, including harm to the [nervous](https://www.ewg.org/consumer-guides/effects-radiofrequency-radiation-nervous-system-ewg-fact-sheet) and [reproductive](https://www.ewg.org/research/how-exposure-cell-phones-and-other-technology-affects-reproductive-health) systems, and [higher risk of cancer](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/04/ewg-letter-published-jama-oncology-evidence-base-potential). Cell phone radiation was classified a [**“possible carcinogen”**](http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external) in 2011 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization. The agency said human epidemiological studies showed a link between higher risk of a type of malignant brain cancer and cell phone use\\n\\n### At home\\n\\nParents and caregivers can exert more control over their kids’ wireless radiation exposure at home than at school, and have more latitude to try new ways of using devices.\\n\\n_Getting started_\\n\\nTo begin, inventory your home’s electronic devices. Consider smart speakers, cordless phones and mouses, gaming consoles, cell phones, wireless security systems and electric alarm clocks, among other types of technology. Even things you might not think emit electromagnetic radiofrequency radiation, like Fitbits and other wearable fitness devices, are a source of wireless radiation exposure and best for young kids to avoid.\\n\\n_Increase distance_\\n\\nThe first, easiest-to-implement option is to increase the distance between your child and wireless devices in the home. The more distance, the less exposure.\\n\\nWired headphones or the speaker mode on a cell phone can put distance between the device and kids’ bodies. They should carry the device in a backpack or bag, not a pocket.\\n\\nWhen no one is actively using the device, make sure it’s in airplane mode. Otherwise, the device will keep seeking the “signal” – it will continue trying to communicate with nearby cell towers, producing unnecessary radiation.\\n\\nAnother simple but important fix: Locate routers and cordless phone base stations – the worst radiation offenders – away from where your kids sleep, study and play. See if you can lower your Wi-Fi router’s output. It may be set to “High” as a default, which could create more intense wireless radiation output than anyone in your household needs.\\n\\n_Choose wired_\\n\\nTo reduce radiation exposures significantly, many experts recommend using wired devices whenever possible. Make replacing wireless headphones with wired your first step then, over time, choose auxiliary devices that plug in or are battery-powered, including keyboards, mouses and microphones. Wireless earbuds also emit radiofrequency radiation, so limit the use of such devices, especially for children and youth.\\n\\nHere are some other ways to reduce exposure to electromagnetic radiation from wireless.\\n\\n_The big picture_\\n\\n*   Aside from the obvious devices (phones, tablets, computers, game consoles), think twice about wireless digital baby monitors and other wireless or virtual devices. If used, such devices and appliances should be kept away from bedrooms and other areas where children sleep.\\n*   Shut off all wireless devices, including your router, at night and when they’re not in use.\\n*   Consult this [checklist](https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/Checklist-EMF-at-Home-EHT.pdf \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external) for a low-electromagnetic field, or EMF, set-up published by [Environmental Health Trust](https://ehtrust.org/ \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external) if you or a family member spend a lot of time at a computer.\\n\\n_At night_\\n\\n*   Strongly encourage your child not to sleep near their wireless gadgets. If this isn’t possible – and let’s face it, with teenagers, you may not succeed at wresting the phone or tablet away – try to convince them to place it away from their head instead of under a pillow.\\n*   Even better, keep electronics out of bedrooms as much as possible, or at least away from beds. This includes TV screens and audio speakers.\\n*   Use an old-fashioned electric or battery alarm clock that doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi. And get one for your children if they claim to need their cell phone so they can get up in the morning.\\n*   Move beds away from utility meters or large appliances, which also emit radiation, even if they’re on the other side of a wall.\\n\\n_Studying, playing and communicating_\\n\\n*   Experts recommend starting a child’s cell phone use as late as practical, considering the family and educational context and needs of each child. The younger kids are, the more vulnerable their bodies are to potentially harmful effects of wireless radiation exposure. \\n*   Encourage your children to use a device’s speaker function or wired earbuds when they want to use their phone to talk.\\n*   Download movies and shows instead of streaming them, then watch in airplane mode. Even better, watch on a wired computer or screen.\\n*   Teach and encourage your children to use their laptop or tablet placed on a table or another hard surface, away from their bodies.\\n*   Get wired – consider getting cords and cables for your kids’ game console, and turning it off when your children finish playing.\\n\\n_Powering down_\\n\\n*   Put phones in airplane mode as much as possible when they are near children, with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off. If they (or you) want to put a phone in a pocket or backpack, turn it off first.\\n*   Also, power devices down when you’re in transit, like on a plane, train, bus or in a car.\\n*   Get to know when radiation emissions are highest – streaming video, traveling in a car, or when the signal is poor – and do what you can to help your child avoid these scenarios. (To see how strong or weak the signal is, check how many bars it has.)\\n\\n### At school\\n\\nParents and caregivers don’t have nearly as much control at school over how much their child is exposed to wireless radiation as they do at home. And with technology ever more prevalent in educational settings, chances are kids are close to a variety of devices all day.\\n\\nNearly half of U.S. schools report having a computer for every child, according to a Department of Education [study](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2021/2021017Summary.pdf \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external). Another 37 percent have a computer for each child in some age groups. In some cases, kids may take the device home with them for long or short periods. The survey also said 70 percent of teachers use technology in the classroom.\\n\\nIt’s tough to shield your child from wireless radiation exposure entirely. But you can take steps to lower their exposure based on advice published by experts. Start by approaching school administrators with your concerns. Learn your school or district’s cell phone policy. If none exists, request that a committee be formed to develop a policy and plan trainings for teachers about safe technology use.\\n\\nHere are a few ideas teachers can implement in the classroom or that schools and school districts can use. The gold standard: Whenever possible, use wired connections for laptops, tablets, interactive white boards, printers and other devices.\\n\\nIf a wired school network isn’t feasible:\\n\\n*   Emphasize keeping devices off and turning them on only when in use – and issue frequent reminders.\\n*   Students’ personal electronic devices, like cell phones, should be turned off or in airplane mode during school.\\n*   Make sure the school policy on wireless device use is posted in classrooms.\\n*   Ask school districts to equip new facilities with wired technology.\\n*   Many experts recommend setting school Wi-Fi routers to the lowest possible level that still allows educational content access, as well as turning off routers when they’re not in use.\\n\\n### Wireless technology use during the pandemic\\n\\nFrom the start of the coronavirus pandemic, wireless technology became the main path for accessing education and participating in virtual classrooms for kids and families in the U.S. and across the globe. In 2020, a [survey](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-age-zero-to-eight-2020 \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external) found nearly half of 2- to 4-year-olds and about two in three kids ages 5 to 8 already owned their own mobile devices, a tablet or smartphone – and that was before the Covid-19-related school closures prompted desperate working parents nationwide to employ wireless devices as babysitters and educators.\\n\\nThat’s many kids with constant access to wireless devices – and also exposed to the health risks of wireless radiation. Parents have taken note of these potential harms. A European citizens group coalition in March [called](https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative-forum/blog/europeans-safe-connections-call-stronger-regulation-wireless-internet-schools_en \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external) for simple steps to protect kids by swapping wireless for cables in places where children spend time and educating the public about the [dangers of exposure](https://envirn.org/e-textbook/ \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external).\\n\\nEarlier this year, [EWG together with more than 22,000 people](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/06/calls-grow-fcc-protect-kids-wireless-radiation) petitioned federal regulators to establish stricter standards for kids’ exposure to wireless devices’ radiofrequency radiation.\\n\\n### For more information\\n\\nTo find additional resources, advocacy guidance, tip sheets and other useful suggestions, consult the websites of one of these organizations:\\n\\n*   The Environmental Health Trust’s “[Wi-Fi in Schools Toolkit](https://ehtrust.org/wifi-in-schools-tool-kit/ \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external)” offers a wealth of resources, including fact sheets and [tip sheets](https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/EHT-Dos-and-Donts-for-Safe-Tech.pdf \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")(link is external), background on the science of EMF exposure, and guidance for parents, teachers and schools.

Globally the numbers and applications of wireless devices are increasing rapidly, but since 1997 safety testing has relied on a large, homogenous, adult male head phantom to simulate exposures; the \\\"Standard Anthropomorphic Mannequin\\\" (SAM) is used to estimate only whether tissue temperature will be increased by more than 1 Celsius degree in the periphery. The present work employs anatomically based modeling currently used to set standards for surgical and medical devices, that incorporates heterogeneous characteristics of age and anatomy. Modeling of a cell phone held to the ear, or of virtual reality devices in front of the eyes, reveals that young eyes and brains absorb substantially higher local radiation doses than adults'. Age-specific simulations indicate the need to apply refined methods for regulatory compliance testing; and for public education regarding manufacturers' advice to keep phones off the body, and prudent use to limit exposures, particularly to protect the young.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Dosimetry; Finite-difference Time-domain simulation; RF-EMF exposure; Specific absorption rate.\\n\\nCopyright © 2018.

EWG’s children’s guideline is the first of its kind and fills a gap left by federal regulators.\\n\\nThe study, published in the journal Environmental Health, relies on the methodology developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to assess human health risks arising from toxic chemical exposures. EWG scientists have applied the same methods to radiofrequency radiation from wireless devices, including cellphones and tablets.\\n\\nEWG recommends the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, adjust its woefully outdated health standards for wireless radiation, last revised a quarter-century ago, well before wireless devices became ubiquitous, heavily used appliances synonymous with modern life. The recommendation draws on data from a landmark 2018 study from the National Toxicology Program, or NTP, [one of the largest long-term studies](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/landmark-federal-study-clear-evidence-linking-cellphone-radiation-cancer) on the health effects of radiofrequency radiation exposure.\\n\\nEWG’s new guidelines, the first developed in the U.S. to focus on children’s health, recommend that children’s exposure overall be 200 to 400 times lower than the whole-body exposure limit set by the FCC in 1996.\\n\\nThe EWG recommended limit for so-called whole-body Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR, for children is 0.2 to 0.4 milliwatts per kilogram, or mW/kg. For adults, EWG recommends a whole-body SAR limit of 2 to 4 mW/kg, which is 20 to 40 times lower than the federal limit.\\n\\nThe FCC has not set a separate standard for children. Its standards for radiofrequency radiation set a maximum SAR of 0.08 watts per kilogram, or W/kg, for whole-body exposure and an SAR for localized spatial peak – the highest exposure level for a specific part of the body, such as the brain – of 1.6 W/kg for the general population.\\n\\nThe NTP studies examined the health effects of 2G and 3G wireless radiation and found there is “[clear evidence](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/cellphones/index.html \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\")” of a link between exposure to radiofrequency radiation and heart tumors in laboratory animals. Similar results were [reported by a team of Italian scientists](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/italian-study-links-cellphone-radiation-heart-and-brain-tumors) from the Ramazzini Institute.\\n\\nEWG's Guide to Safe Cell Phone Use\\n\\nReduce your exposure to harmful wireless radiation with EWG's top tips for safer cell phone use.\\n\\n**Sign up today to get an electronic copy of EWG's Guide to Safer Cell Phone Use - delivered right to your inbox.**\\n\\nGet Your Copy: EWG's Guide to Safer Cell Phone Use\\n\\nContact Information\\n\\nCountryUnited States ZIP Code\\n\\nEmail\\n\\n(Optional)\\n\\n![Image 3](https://secure.everyaction.com/v1/Track/d3VlPLsqe0KvbH1sFEnOeA2?formSessionId=1c1cae70-ff11-444a-8d54-184d7697b547&bName=chrome&dType=desktop&formVersion=7/19/2021%206:07:38%20PM|&fUrl=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXdnLm9yZy9uZXdzLWluc2lnaHRzL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZS8yMDIxLzA3L3N0dWR5LXdpcmVsZXNzLXJhZGlhdGlvbi1leHBvc3VyZS1jaGlsZHJlbi1zaG91bGQtYmUtaHVuZHJlZHM%3D&fRef=)\\n\\nYour donation will be securely processed.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://d1aqhv4sn5kxtx.cloudfront.net/actiontag/assets/images/fast-action.svg)](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-login)[?](https://fastaction.ngpvan.com/##whats-this) Take future action with a single click.  \\n[Log in](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-login) or  [Sign up](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-signup) for _Fast_**Action**\\n\\nYou'll also receive EWG's exclusive email updates, action alerts, promotions to support our work and environmental tips.

In the meantime, EWG’s recommendation for strict, lower exposure limits for all radiofrequency sources, especially for children.\\n\\nWhen the FCC established its radiofrequency radiation limits, following the passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, relatively few Americans, and likely no children, owned and used cellphones.\\n\\nMuch has changed since the federal limits were set, including technology and how these devices are used. A [survey](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-age-zero-to-eight-2020 \\\"(opens in a new window)\\\") completed by the nonprofit Common Sense Media in March 2020, just before the start of the Covid-19 spread in the U.S., found that 46 percent of 2- to 4-year-olds, and 67 percent of 5- to 8-year-olds, had their own mobile devices, such as a tablet or smartphone.\\n\\nWith remote learning, a necessity during the Covid-19 pandemic, phones, tablets and other wireless devices became a part of life for young children, tweens and teens nationwide.\\n\\n“The FCC must consider the latest scientific research, which shows that radiation from these devices can affect health, especially for children,” said [Uloma Uche, Ph.D.](https://www.ewg.org/who-we-are/our-team/uloma-uche-phd), EWG environmental health science fellow and lead author of the study.\\n\\n“It has been 25 years since the FCC set its limits for radiofrequency radiation. With multiple sources of radiofrequency radiation in the everyday environment, including Wi-Fi, wireless devices and cell towers, protecting children’s health from wireless radiation exposures should be a priority for the FCC,” she added.\\n\\nTake action on cellphone radiation!\\n\\n**Cutting-edge research by EWG has revealed that federal regulations on cellphone radiation are woefully outdated and unsafe!**\\n\\nUse the form below to add your name to EWG's petition calling on the FCC to protect our health from radiofrequency radiation.\\n\\nTake action on cellphone radiation!\\n\\nContact Information\\n\\nCountryUnited States Postal Code\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nRemember me so that I can use _Fast_**Action** next time.\\n\\n(Optional)\\n\\n![Image 5](https://secure.everyaction.com/v1/Track/shFqqi_IiEyntVkdJ_MR4Q2?formSessionId=a8417fb1-a54c-4516-8daa-140570dc793d&bName=chrome&dType=desktop&formVersion=7/19/2021%208:30:14%20PM|4/16/2020%201:23:09%20PM&fUrl=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXdnLm9yZy9uZXdzLWluc2lnaHRzL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZS8yMDIxLzA3L3N0dWR5LXdpcmVsZXNzLXJhZGlhdGlvbi1leHBvc3VyZS1jaGlsZHJlbi1zaG91bGQtYmUtaHVuZHJlZHM%3D&fRef=)\\n\\nYour donation will be securely processed.\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://d1aqhv4sn5kxtx.cloudfront.net/actiontag/assets/images/fast-action.svg)](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-login)[?](https://fastaction.ngpvan.com/##whats-this) Take future action with a single click.  \\n[Log in](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-login) or  [Sign up](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/07/study-wireless-radiation-exposure-children-should-be-hundreds#fastaction-signup) for _Fast_**Action**\\n\\nShow your support  \\nwith a single click\\n=======================================\\n\\nAutofill forms quickly and securely with _Fast_**Action**\\n\\n[Sign up with your email address](https://fastaction.ngpvan.com/sign_up)\\n\\nAlready have a _Fast_**Action** account?

We strongly believe those exposures deserve far more investigation and scientific rigor than has been applied to date.”\\n\\n“The evidence shows that children absorb more radiofrequency radiation than adults, and the developing body of a child is more vulnerable to such effects,” said [Olga Naidenko, Ph.D.](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/our-experts/olga-naidenko-phd), EWG’s vice president for science investigations and co-author of the study.\\n\\n“More research on the safety and sustainability of wireless technology is essential,” added Naidenko. “Meanwhile, there are simple steps everyone can take to protect their health, such as keeping wireless devices farther from their bodies.”\\n\\nThere are a number of easy, precautionary steps consumers can take until the government conducts the rigorous scientific assessment the issue deserves, which should have occurred years ago.\\n\\n“Based on our review of the health risks and the inadequacy of current standards to protect children, while the science evolves, it is perfectly reasonable for parents to consider minimizing or eliminating radiofrequency radiation sources at home by relying more on wired internet access, and to urge schools to take comparable steps to reduce classroom and campus exposure,” said Cook.\\n\\nOther health-protective tips for consumers who want to reduce radiofrequency radiation from wireless devices include using a headset or speaker, texting instead of talking, and limiting the time children spend on smart phones.\\n\\nFind all of EWG’s tips to reduce exposure to wireless radiation [here](https://static.ewg.org/ewg-tip-sheets/EWG-CellPhoneGuide.pdf?_ga=2.49040037.248710970.1626091146-544982251.1586179216).\\n\\nEWG’s recommendation for limits for radiofrequency radiation exposure is its latest effort to advance the public dialogue about science-based standards that protect public health.\\n\\n###\\n\\n_The Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.

With the rise of wireless devices like smartphones, tablets, and Wi-Fi routers, parents and health experts are expressing growing concerns about the impact of EMF exposure on children’s health. This article will explore the potential dangers of EMF radiation for children and introduce the Milerd HiRange as an essential tool designed to monitor and help protect children from harmful EMF exposure.\\n\\nUnderstanding EMF Radiation\\n---------------------------\\n\\nEMF radiation consists of energy waves emitted from various electronic devices, including mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, and tablets. These waves fall into different radiation frequency categories, broadly classified as low-frequency and high-frequency EMFs.\\n\\nLow-frequency EMF comes from household devices like microwaves and electric lines, while high-frequency EMF is generated by wireless technologies such as mobile networks and RF radiation. In a typical household, common radiation sources include wireless routers, baby monitors, and tablets, all of which contribute to the cumulative EMF exposure that children experience daily.\\n\\nWhy Are Children More Vulnerable to EMF?\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nChildren are particularly susceptible to the health risks associated with EMF exposure due to their biological differences. Their developing bodies, along with thinner skulls, make them more prone to radiation absorption compared to adults. This vulnerability raises concerns about the radiation effects on children, including disrupted sleep patterns, behavioral changes, and possible developmental impacts from long-term EMF exposure.\\n\\nRecent radiation studies indicate that children may experience heightened sensitivity to EMF, emphasizing the need for child protection measures in environments where they spend significant time. Given these findings, it’s crucial to understand the potential health risks linked to EMF radiation.\\n\\n### Assessing EMF Risks at Home and School\\n\\nTo effectively manage EMF risks, it is essential to monitor radiation levels in homes and schools. The Milerd HiRange serves as a reliable tool for detecting and measuring EMF exposure, enabling parents and educators to establish safe EMF levels.\\n\\nRegular assessments using devices like the Milerd HiRange can help ensure that EMF levels remain within recommended safety guidelines. Moreover, its feature for tracking cumulative radiation exposure is especially valuable, allowing parents to monitor children’s exposure over time and adjust their environments accordingly.\\n\\n### Practical Tips for Reducing EMF Exposure in Children\\n\\nImplementing radiation protection techniques can significantly reduce EMF exposure for children. For instance, using RF shields for devices and strategically placing wireless routers away from children’s bedrooms or play areas can minimize their exposure to wireless radiation.\\n\\nAdditionally, reducing screen time for children and limiting their use of mobile phones and tablets—particularly at night—can further decrease their risk of EMF-related health issues. By utilizing radiation monitoring devices like the Milerd HiRange, parents can identify high-exposure areas and adjust their environments to ensure their children’s safety.\\n\\nWhat Can Parents Do to Protect Their Children?\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nCreating a safe environment is paramount for protecting children from EMF exposure. Parents can rearrange home setups to minimize EMF exposure and utilize the Milerd HiRange for ongoing monitoring of radiation levels.\\n\\nStaying informed about the latest EMF research and safety guidelines is essential for ensuring that children’s spaces comply with health recommendations. Furthermore, schools and communities should be encouraged to adopt practices that reduce EMF exposure, such as creating EMF-free zones and incorporating radiation safety training into educational programs.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn summary, monitoring and managing children’s EMF exposure is vital due to their increased vulnerability. By implementing protective measures and utilizing devices like the Milerd [HiRange](https://milerd.com/products/hirange), parents can ensure a safer environment for their children in an increasingly technology-driven world. Prioritize your child’s health and safety by investing in reliable tools for electromagnetic safety and staying informed about potential EMF dangers.\\n\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"index\": 10,\n        \"website\": \"Title: Electromagnetic Fields and Cancer\\n\\nURL Source: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet\\n\\nMarkdown Content:\\nWhat are electric and magnetic fields?\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nElectric and magnetic fields are invisible areas of energy (also called radiation) that are produced by electricity, which is the movement of electrons, or current, through a wire.\\n\\nAn electric field is produced by voltage, which is the pressure used to push the electrons through the wire, much like water being pushed through a pipe. As the voltage increases, the electric field increases in strength. Electric fields are measured in volts per meter (V/m).\\n\\nA magnetic field results from the flow of current through wires or electrical devices and increases in strength as the current increases. The strength of a magnetic field decreases rapidly with increasing distance from its source. Magnetic fields are measured in microteslas (μT, or millionths of a tesla).\\n\\nElectric fields are produced whether or not a device is turned on, whereas magnetic fields are produced only when current is flowing, which usually requires a device to be turned on. Power lines produce magnetic fields continuously because current is always flowing through them. Electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects, whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials.\\n\\nElectric and magnetic fields together are referred to as electromagnetic fields, or EMFs. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by [electromagnetic radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000270739&version=Patient&language=English). There are two main categories of EMFs:\\n\\n*   Higher-frequency EMFs, which include [x-rays](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045944&version=Patient&language=English) and [gamma rays](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000270730&version=Patient&language=English). These EMFs are in the [ionizing radiation](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000430698&version=Patient&language=English) part of the electromagnetic spectrum and can damage [DNA](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045671&version=Patient&language=English) or cells directly.\\n*   Low- to mid-frequency EMFs, which include static fields (electric or magnetic fields that do not vary with time), magnetic fields from electric power lines and appliances, radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, and visible light. These EMFs are in the non-ionizing radiation part of the electromagnetic spectrum and are not known to damage DNA or cells directly. Low- to mid-frequency EMFs include extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) and radiofrequency EMFs. ELF-EMFs have frequencies of up to 300 cycles per second, or hertz (Hz), and radiofrequency EMFs range from 3 kilohertz (3 kHz, or 3,000 Hz) to 300 gigahertz (300 GHz, or 300 billion Hz). Radiofrequency radiation is measured in watts per meter squared (W/m2).\\n\\nThe electromagnetic spectrum represents all of the possible frequencies of electromagnetic energy. It ranges from extremely long wavelengths (extremely low frequency exposures such as those from power lines) to extremely short wavelengths (x-rays and gamma rays) and includes both non-ionizing and ionizing radiation.\\n\\nWhat are common sources of non-ionizing EMFs?\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are both natural and human-made sources of non-ionizing EMFs. The earth’s magnetic field, which causes the needle on a compass to point North, is one example of a naturally occurring EMF.\\n\\nHuman-made EMFs fall into both the ELF and radiofrequency categories of non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These EMFs can come from a number of sources.\\n\\n**Extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs).** Sources of ELF-EMFs include power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical appliances such as shavers, hair dryers, and electric blankets.\\n\\n**Radiofrequency radiation.** The most common sources of radiofrequency radiation are wireless telecommunication devices and equipment, including cell phones, smart meters, and portable wireless devices, such as tablets and laptop computers ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)). In the United States, cell phones currently operate in a frequency range of about 1.8 to 2.2 GHz ([2](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r2)). (For more information about cell phones, see the NCI fact sheet [Cell Phones and Cancer Risk](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet).)\\n\\nOther common sources of radiofrequency radiation include:\\n\\n*   **Radio and television signals.** AM/FM radios and older VHF/UHF televisions operate at lower radiofrequencies than cell phones. Radio signals are AM (amplitude-modulated) or FM (frequency-modulated). AM radio is used for broadcasting over very long distances, whereas FM radio covers more localized areas. AM signals are transmitted from large arrays of antennas that are placed at high elevation on sites that are off limits to the general public because exposures close to the source can be high. Maintenance workers could receive substantial radiofrequency exposures from AM radio antennas, but the general public would not. FM radio antennas and TV broadcasting antennas, which are much smaller than AM antennas, are generally mounted at the top of high towers. Radiofrequency exposures near the base of these towers are below guideline limits ([3](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r3)), so exposure of the general population is very low. Sometimes small local radio and TV antennas are mounted on the top of a building; access to the roof of such buildings is usually controlled.\\n*   **Radar, satellite stations, [magnetic resonance imaging](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045997&version=Patient&language=en) (MRI) devices, and industrial equipment.**These operate at somewhat higher radiofrequencies than cell phones ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)).\\n*   **Microwave ovens** used in homes, which also operate at somewhat higher radiofrequencies than cell phones ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)). Microwave ovens are manufactured with effective shielding that has reduced the leakage of radiofrequency radiation from these appliances to barely detectable levels.\\n*   **Cordless telephones**, which can operate on analogue or DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) technology and typically emit radiofrequencies similar to those of cell phones. However, because cordless phones have a limited range and require a nearby base, their signal strengths are generally much lower than those of cell phones ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)).\\n*   **Cell phone base stations.** Antenna towers or base stations, including those for mobile phone networks and for broadcasting for radio and for television, emit various types of radiofrequency energy. Because the majority of individuals in the general population are exposed only intermittently to base stations and broadcast antennas, it is difficult to estimate exposures for a population ([4](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r4)). The strength of these exposures varies based on the population density of the region, the average distance from the source, and the time of day or the day of the week (lower exposures on the weekends or at night) ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)). A study that used using personal portable exposure meters to assess exposures to different sources of radiofrequency EMFs among children in Europe found that the single largest contributor to the total radiofrequency EMF exposure was the proximity to base stations ([5](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r5)).In general, exposures decrease with increasing distance from the source ([6](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r6)). Exposures among maintenance workers have been found to vary depending on their tasks, the type of antenna, and the location of the worker in relation to the source ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)). Cumulative exposures of such workers are very difficult to estimate.\\n    \\n*   ****T******elevisions and computer screens** produce electric and magnetic fields at various frequencies, as well as static electric fields. The liquid crystal displays found in some laptop and desktop computers do not produce substantial electric or magnetic fields. Modern computers have conductive screens that reduce static fields produced by the screen to normal background levels.\\n*   **Wireless local area networks**, commonly known as Wi-Fi. These are specific types of wireless networking systems and an increasingly common source of radiofrequency radiation. Wireless networks use [radio waves](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000651209&version=Patient&language=en) to connect Wi-Fi–enabled devices to an access point that is connected to the internet, either physically or through some form of data connection. Most Wi-Fi devices operate at radiofrequencies that are broadly similar to cell phones, typically 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, although in recent years Wi-Fi devices that operate at somewhat higher frequencies (5, 5.3, or 5.8 GHz) have appeared ([7](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r7)). Radiofrequency radiation exposure from Wi-Fi devices is considerably lower than that from cell phones ([8](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r8)). Both sources emit levels of radiofrequency radiation that are far below the guideline of 10 W/m2 as specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ([3](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r3)).\\n*   **Digital electric and gas meters, also known as “smart meters.”** These devices, which operate at about the same radiofrequencies as cell phones, transmit information on consumption of electricity or gas to utility companies. Smart meters produce very low level fields that sometimes cannot be distinguished from the total background radiofrequency radiation levels inside a home ([9](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r9)).\\n\\nFor household appliances and other devices used in the home that require electricity, magnetic field levels are highest near the source of the field and decrease rapidly the farther away the user is from the source. Magnetic fields drop precipitously at a distance of about 1 foot from most appliances. For computer screens, at a distance of 12–20 inches from the screen that most persons using computers sit, magnetic fields are similarly dramatically lower.\\n\\nWhy are non-ionizing EMFs studied in relation to cancer?\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPower lines and electrical appliances that emit non-ionizing EMFs are present everywhere in homes and workplaces. For example, wireless local networks are nearly always “on” and are increasingly commonplace in homes, schools, and many public places.\\n\\nNo mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified. Unlike high-energy (ionizing) radiation, EMFs in the non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot damage [DNA](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045671&version=Patient&language=English) or cells directly. Some scientists have speculated that ELF-EMFs could cause cancer through other mechanisms, such as by reducing levels of the hormone [melatonin](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000440118&version=Patient&language=English). There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain tumors.\\n\\nStudies of animals have not provided any indications that exposure to ELF-EMFs is associated with cancer ([10](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r10)–[13](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r13)). The few high-quality studies in animals have provided no evidence that Wi-Fi is harmful to health ([8](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r8)).\\n\\nAlthough there is no known mechanism by which non-ionizing EMFs could damage DNA and cause cancer, even a small increase in risk would be of clinical importance given how widespread exposure to these fields is.\\n\\nWhat have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in children?\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNumerous epidemiologic studies and comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature have evaluated possible associations between exposure to non-ionizing EMFs and risk of cancer in children ([13](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r13)–[15](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r15)). (Magnetic fields are the component of non-ionizing EMFs that are usually studied in relation to their possible health effects.) Most of the research has focused on [leukemia](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045343&version=Patient&language=en) and [brain tumors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000387264&version=Patient&language=en), the two most common cancers in children. Studies have examined associations of these cancers with living near power lines, with magnetic fields in the home, and with exposure of parents to high levels of magnetic fields in the workplace. No consistent evidence for an association between any source of non-ionizing EMF and cancer has been found.\\n\\n**Exposure from power lines.** Although a study in 1979 pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia ([16](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r16)), more recent studies have had mixed findings ([17](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r17)–[25](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r25)). Most of these studies did not find an association or found one only for those children who lived in homes with very high levels of magnetic fields, which are present in few residences.\\n\\nSeveral studies have analyzed the combined data from multiple studies of power line exposure and childhood leukemia:\\n\\n*   A pooled analysis of nine studies reported a twofold increase in risk of childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.4 μT or higher. Less than 1% of the children in the studies experienced this level of exposure ([26](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r26)).\\n*   A [meta-analysis](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000691484&version=Patient&language=en) of 15 studies observed a 1.7-fold increase in childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.3 μT or higher. A little more than 3% of children in the studies experienced this level of exposure ([27](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r27)).\\n*   More recently, a pooled analysis of seven studies published after 2000 reported a 1.4-fold increase in childhood leukemia among children with exposures of 0.3 μT or higher. However, less than one half of 1% of the children in the studies experienced this level of exposure ([28](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r28)). \\n\\nFor the two pooled studies and the meta-analysis, the number of highly exposed children was too small to provide stable estimates of the dose–response relationship. This means that the findings could be interpreted to reflect linear increases in risk, a threshold effect at 0.3 or 0.4 μT, or no [significant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000390271&version=Patient&language=en) increase.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the finding of increased childhood leukemia risk among children with the highest exposures (at least 0.3 μT) is unclear.\\n\\n**Exposure from electrical appliances.** Another way that children can be exposed to magnetic fields is from household electrical appliances. Although magnetic fields near many electrical appliances are higher than those near power lines, appliances contribute less to a person’s total exposure to magnetic fields because most appliances are used for only short periods of time. And moving even a short distance from most electrical appliances reduces exposure dramatically. Again, studies have not found consistent evidence for an association between the use of household electrical appliances and risk of childhood leukemia ([29](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r29)).\\n\\n**Exposure to Wi-Fi.** In view of the widespread use of Wi-Fi in schools, the UK Health Protection Agency (now part of [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england)) has conducted the largest and most comprehensive measurement studies to assess exposures of children to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from wireless computer networks ([30](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r30), [31](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r31)). This agency concluded that radiofrequency exposures were well below recommended maximum levels and that there was “no reason why Wi-Fi should not continue to be used in schools and in other places” ([32](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r32)).\\n\\nA review of the published literature concluded that the few high-quality studies to date provide no evidence of biological effects from Wi-Fi exposures ([7](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r7)).\\n\\n**Exposure from cell phone base stations.** Few studies have examined cancer risk in children living close to cell phone base stations or radio or television transmitters. Mobile phone base stations transmit and receive radiofrequency signals to and from mobile phones near the station. None of the studies that estimated exposures on an individual level found an increased risk of pediatric tumors ([33](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r33)–[35](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r35)).\\n\\n**Parental exposure and risk in offspring.** Several studies have examined possible associations between maternal or paternal exposure to high levels of magnetic fields before [conception](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000446922&version=Patient&language=en) and/or during pregnancy and the risk of cancer in their future children. The results to date have been inconsistent ([36](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r36), [37](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r37)). This question requires further evaluation.\\n\\n**Exposure and cancer survival.** A few studies have investigated whether magnetic field exposure is associated with prognosis or survival of children with leukemia. Several small [retrospective](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044120&version=Patient&language=en) studies of this question have yielded inconsistent results ([38](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r38)–[40](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r40)). An analysis that combined [prospective](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044079&version=Patient&language=en) data for more than 3,000 children with acute lymphoid leukemia from eight countries showed that ELF magnetic field exposure was not associated with their survival or risk of [relapse](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045866&version=Patient&language=en) ([41](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r41)).\\n\\nWhat have studies shown about possible associations between non-ionizing EMFs and cancer in adults?\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMany studies have examined the association between non-ionizing EMF exposure and cancer in adults, of which few studies have reported evidence of increased risk ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r1)).\\n\\n**Residential exposures.** The majority of epidemiologic studies have shown no relationship between [breast cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000444971&version=Patient&language=en) in women and exposure to extremely low frequency EMFs (ELF-EMFs) in the home ([42](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r42)–[45](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r45)), although a few individual studies have suggested an association; only one reported results that were [statistically significant](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044167&version=Patient&language=en) ([46](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r46)).\\n\\n**Workplace exposures to ELF radiation.** Several studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s reported that people who worked in some electrical occupations that exposed them to ELF radiation (such as power station operators and telephone line workers) had higher-than-expected rates of some types of cancer, particularly [leukemia](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045343&version=Patient&language=en), [brain tumors](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000387264&version=Patient&language=en), and [male breast cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000445046&version=Patient&language=en) ([13](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r13)). Most of the results were based on participants’ job titles and not on actual measurements of their exposures.  More recent studies, including some that considered exposure measurements as well as job titles, have generally not shown an increasing risk of leukemia, brain tumors, or female breast cancer with increasing exposure to magnetic fields at work ([46](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r46)–[51](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r51)).\\n\\n**Workplace exposures to radiofrequency radiation.** A limited number of studies have evaluated risks of cancer in workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation. A large study of U.S. Navy personnel found no excess of brain tumors among those with a high probability of exposure to radar (including electronics technicians, aviation technicians, and fire control technicians); however, nonlymphocytic leukemia, particularly [acute myeloid leukemia](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046347&version=Patient&language=en), was increased in electronics technicians in aviation squadrons, but not in Navy personnel in the other job categories ([52](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r52)). A [case–control study](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000348989&version=Patient&language=en) among U.S. Air Force personnel found the suggestion of an increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment ([53](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r53)). A case–control study found the suggestion of an increased risk of death from brain cancer among men occupationally exposed to microwave and/or radiofrequency radiation, with all of the excess risk among workers in electrical and electronics jobs involving design, manufacture, repair, or installation of electrical or electronics equipment ([54](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r54)). There was no evidence that electrical utility workers who were exposed to pulsed electromagnetic fields produced by power lines were more likely to develop brain tumors or leukemia than the general population ([55](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r55)). Employees of a large manufacturer of wireless communication products were not more likely to die from brain tumors or cancers of the [hematopoietic](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044036&version=Patient&language=en) or [lymphatic system](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045764&version=Patient&language=en) than the general population ([56](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r56)). A large [prospective](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044079&version=Patient&language=en) study among police officers in Great Britain found no evidence for an association between radiofrequency EMF exposure from personal radio use and the risk of all cancers combined ([57](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r57)). A large multinational population-based case–control study found no clear evidence that occupational exposures to radiofrequency radiation are associated with increased risks of glioma or meningioma ([58](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r58)).\\n\\nWhat do expert organizations conclude about the cancer risk from EMFs?\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization, appointed an expert Working Group to review all available evidence on static and extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields ([13](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r13)). The Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as “possibly carcinogenic to humans,” based on limited evidence from human studies in relation to childhood leukemia. Static electric and magnetic fields and extremely low frequency electric fields were determined “not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans” ([13](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r13)).\\n\\nIn 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks reviewed [electromagnetic fields](http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/en/electromagnetic-fields/index.htm#10)[Exit Disclaimer](https://www.cancer.gov/policies/linking \\\"Exit Disclaimer\\\") in general, as well as cell phones in particular. It found that, overall, epidemiologic studies of extremely low frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 μT, although no mechanisms have been identified and there is no support from experimental studies that explains these findings. It also found that the epidemiologic studies on radiofrequency exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumors or other cancers of the head and neck region, although the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open ([59](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#r59)).\\n\\nWhere can people find additional information on EMFs?\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) website has [information](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/emf/index.cfm) about EMFs and cancer.\\n\\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration website has [information](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/elfradiation/) about workplace exposures to ELF-EMF.\\n\\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency website has [information](http://www3.epa.gov/radtown/electric-magnetic-fields.html) on power lines and other sources of EMF.\\n\\nThe European Commission also has general [information](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/en/electromagnetic-fields07/index.htm#il1)[Exit Disclaimer](https://www.cancer.gov/policies/linking \\\"Exit Disclaimer\\\") on EMF.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization website also has [information](https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields#tab=tab_1)[Exit Disclaimer](https://www.cancer.gov/policies/linking \\\"Exit Disclaimer\\\") on EMF.\\n\\nSelected References\\n-------------------\\n\\n1.
