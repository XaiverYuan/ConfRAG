You are given:
- A question
- A set of webpage contents, each with a corresponding index
- A target number of clusters (clustering number)

# Task
Your task is to process the webpage contents and organize them into the required number of clusters based on their answers to the question.

# Rule
Each cluster should contain:
1. A single core "answer" that represents the main viewpoint of the group.
2. A list of "index" values representing the webpages that support this answer.
3. A list of "reason" entries explaining why this answer is supported. Each reason should be a concise, specific point.

# Instructions:
- You must create exactly [CLUSTERING NUMBER] clusters, no more, no fewer.
- You must include all index in your clusters, do not miss anyone.
- Each answer should be distinct and represent a unique viewpoint.
- Supporting Reasons must be grounded in the content of the webpages. Do not invent information that is not present in the original content.
- Be concise and factual. Avoid redundant or overly generic answers and reasons.
- If a webpage content supports multiple reasons under the same answer, include all relevant reasons under the corresponding answer.
- Output must be a valid JSON object exactly as specified. Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations outside the JSON.
- Clusters must form a non-overlapping partition of all indexes: each index must appear in one and only one cluster.

# Example
Output strictly in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "answer": "The core answer representing one cluster.",
      "index": [1, 3],
      "reason": ["Supporting reason 1", "Supporting reason 2"]
    },
    {
      "answer": "The core answer representing another cluster.",
      "index": [2],
      "reason": ["Supporting reason 3", "Supporting reason 4"]
    }
    // Continue until [CLUSTERING NUMBER] clusters are completed
  ]
}

# Attention
- The numeric contents of the index arrays in different answers must not overlap. Each index should appear in exactly one index list.(such as "index": 1, 3 in [1, 3] and 2 in index [2] are mutually exclusive)
- Each reason must be clearly supported by content from the corresponding webpage(s). Do not fabricate or generalize beyond what is explicitly stated.
- The entire output must be a valid JSON object that follows the given format strictlyâ€”no additional comments, metadata, or text.
- Ensure that the total set of indexes across all clusters forms a complete partition: every original index is included and none are duplicated.
