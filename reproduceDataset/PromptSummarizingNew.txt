You are given a set of structured answer-reason-index triples that have been extracted from multiple webpages in response to a specific factual question. Each entry includes:
- An `index` indicating the source webpage number
- A proposed `answer` that summarizes the main viewpoint expressed on that page
- A list of `reason`s that support that answer

Your task is to:
1. **Cluster the answers into semantically consistent groups**, where each group represents a distinct, coherent viewpoint.
    - If multiple answers express the same meaning using different wording, group them into one cluster.
    - Each webpage index can appear in **only one answer cluster**. Do not assign the same index to multiple answers.

2. **Aggregate the reasons** for each answer cluster:
    - Combine reasons with similar meaning from different indexes into a unified reason entry.
    - Each reason should include the list of indexes where it was found.
    - An index may support multiple reasons, but only within the same answer group.

3. **Discard meaningless or unrelated content**:
    - If a given index corresponds to irrelevant, incoherent, or meaningless content, do not include it in any answer cluster.
    - In that case, include its index in the `additional` field with a brief explanation.

4. **Detect contradictions** between answer clusters:
    - If two or more answer clusters express mutually exclusive claims, set `contradicts: true`; otherwise, use `false`.

5. **Avoid hallucinations**:
    - You must not add any content that is not present in the input.
    - Each answer and each reason must directly reflect the inputs they came from.

### Output format (JSON):
```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "answer": "Clustered answer representing a shared viewpoint.",
      "answer judge keyword": ["keyword1", "keyword2"], 
      "index": [0, 3, 5],
      "reason": [
        {
          "explain": "A unified reason that supports this answer.",
          "reason judge keyword": ["reason_keyword1", "reason_keyword2"],
          "index": [0, 3]
        },
        {
          "explain": "Another reason with different emphasis.",
          "reason judge keyword": ["reason_keyword3"],
          "index": [5]
        }
      ]
    },

      "index": [1, 2],
      "reason": [
        {
          "explain": "A reason explaining this opposing viewpoint.",
          "reason judge keyword": ["reason_keyword5"],
          "index": [1]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "contradicts": true,
  "additional": "Indexes 8 and 17 were discarded due to irrelevant or meaningless content."
}
Notes for the model:
- Be strict: Do not hesitate to discard data. If an index includes content that is off-topic, spammy, or incoherent, you must explain it in the additional field and leave it out of all answer clusters.
- Be grounded: Do not invent keywords, reasons, or relationships. Everything you include must come from the inputs provided.
- "answer judge keyword" should be a **minimal but sufficient** list of phrases or words that, when **all are matched**, indicate that a model has provided this answer. 
- Avoid using overly generic words like "stages", "highest-ranking", or single years like "1857" unless they are paired with context. Use phrases instead (e.g., "control by 1818", "direct British rule").
- Do not use judge keywords that overlap significantly with those from other answer clusters. All keywords in the list must appear in the response for it to count as a match.
