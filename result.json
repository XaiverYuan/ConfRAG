A single core \"answer\" that represents the main viewpoint of the group.\n2. A list of \"index\" values representing the webpages that support this answer.\n3. A list of \"reason\" entries explaining why this answer is supported. Each reason should be a concise, specific point.\n\n# Instructions:\n- You must create exactly 3 clusters, no more, no fewer.\n- You must include all index in your clusters, do not miss anyone.\n- Each answer should be distinct and represent a unique viewpoint.\n- Supporting Reasons must be grounded in the content of the webpages. Do not invent information that is not present in the original content.\n- Be concise and factual. Avoid redundant or overly generic answers and reasons.\n- If a webpage content supports multiple reasons under the same answer, include all relevant reasons under the corresponding answer.\n- Output must be a valid JSON object exactly as specified. Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations outside the JSON.\n- Clusters must form a non-overlapping partition of all indexes: each index must appear in one and only one cluster.\n\n# Example\nOutput strictly in the following JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"answers\": [\n    {\n      \"answer\": \"The core answer representing one cluster.\",\n      \"index\": [1, 3],\n      \"reason\": [\"Supporting reason 1\", \"Supporting reason 2\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"answer\": \"The core answer representing another cluster.\",\n      \"index\": [2],\n      \"reason\": [\"Supporting reason 3\", \"Supporting reason 4\"]\n    }\n    // Continue until 3 clusters are completed\n  ]\n}\n\n# Attention\n- The numeric contents of the index arrays in different answers must not overlap. Each index should appear in exactly one index list.(such as \"index\": 1, 3 in [1, 3] and 2 in index [2] are mutually exclusive)\n- Each reason must be clearly supported by content from the corresponding webpage(s). Do not fabricate or generalize beyond what is explicitly stated.\n- The entire output must be a valid JSON object that follows the given format strictly—no additional comments, metadata, or text.\n- Ensure that the total set of indexes across all clusters forms a complete partition: every original index is included and none are duplicated.\n"

Dragon Slayers series vs Heroes of Legend series vs Trails series  \\nHonkai Impact 3rd is part of the main Honkai Project family, being just one of the multiple Honkai games. Genshin Impact is a spin-off of the Honkai series.  \\n  \\nHonkai Impact is more like a Visual Novel merged with a brawler (beat 'em up) game. Imagine playing .hack, DMC, Tekken or Persona with short fighting stages in between and long long dialog cutscenes. With story/character design/settings copy-cat from Evagelion, Touhou and Blazblue. There's also a bunch of game genres (Shooting, Platformer, Sports, Board Game, etc) added to the game as mini games and events. So consider this a huge experiment ground for miHoYo as well as a jack of all trades in game genre wise. On the bright side, it's pretty hard to get bored with all those \\\"experimental\\\" new stuffs in each update.  \\n  \\nGenshin Impact is known as a \\\"degraded\\\" copy-cat version of Zelda: BOTW. You can consider it as an Open world Action RPG. They are not even on the same genre with HI3rd eventhough HI3rd do have some \\\"Stand-Alone\\\" Open world RPGs added to some of its chapters/arc/side events, HI3rd is still basically a \\\"brawler\\\" game and GI's \\\"ARPG\\\" like Zelda. Well... \\\"like\\\" is probably not accurate here, because [they copy a lot of BOTW mechanism down to the core in a 100% cloning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ooAfSSn5V4). Although GI started with a boo-boo being called \\\"The Bad clone of Zelda\\\" or \\\"Zelda's Rip-Off\\\", but over the years GI have added enough(?) contents to keep the game interesting. But still, it can only rival BOTW if we take away all the ridiculous RNG and Gambling stuffs (eg Gacha) from the game.  \\n  \\nAs for contents, Genshin is newer, and the update speed is slow. While on the other hand HI3rd is old with new contents and events added every 2 week and a version update every 45 days. So you can easily tell that Genshin will have better engine and graphic due to it's newer, but HI3rd has far more contents due to its age and update speed.  \\n  \\nThe new Honkai Star Rail is the newest series to the Honkai series, but weirdly they didn't give it a numbering in the Original Chinese version (eg, HG1, HG2, HI3), hinting that it may still be a spin-off of HI3rd itself. Kinda like Trails and LoH series or Megami Tensei and Persona series. And yes, these games are made in China by miHoYo, a company in Shanghai.  \\n  \\nIf you are looking for a new adventure to start and wanted to play an anime themed Online MMO game... then my advise is probably, be a bit patient and wait for the up coming \\\"Blue Protocol\\\" from Japan. Where originality wins over copy cats.

Gameplay wise: Genshin is very limited due to its forced adherence to the perspective of the traveller. Everything you do in Genshin is in the third person and is unable to be changed. In Honkai, they’re free to make as diverse a game mode they want (as long as the character are the same as in-game). Last update we had a game mode close to PvZ and now we have fall guys. Events story wise: reiterating my statement from earlier, Genshin is forced to stay stuck to the traveller’s storyline. No event can come back the same way after each release. Plus crucial story plots for certain characters motivations are locked to these specific events. Honkai, on the other hand, can use any character it wants to make a story because of the multiverse. Plus there is a literal completely separate storyline spanning several events that are re-running with their only changes being rewards. I hope you like my endless rambling essay comparing two games made by the same company. ~ sincerely a traveller and a captain.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n209\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n14 replies\\n\\n14 replies\\n\\n![Image 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\n### [@assasinegaming01](https://www.youtube.com/@assasinegaming01)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c&lc=UgwYvjFPidUU6m_ejUR4AaABAg)\\n\\n\\\"Genshin Impact\\\" Shows Honkai Impact \\\"or Honkai Impact\\\" Shows Genshin Impact Are you ok?\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n578\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n14 replies\\n\\n14 replies\\n\\n![Image 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\n### [@anuradhamallick138](https://www.youtube.com/@anuradhamallick138)\\n\\n[1 year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c&lc=Ugz-_hpUz-GOa8pypHF4AaABAg)\\n\\nHonkai Impact 3rd dogwalks Introduction: Honkai 3 Story/Plot: Honkai 3 Development: Honkai 3 Protagnoist: Honkai 3 Antagonist: Honkai 3 Deuterogonist: Honkai 3 Journey: Honkai 3 Emotions: Honkai 3 Main Cast: Honkai 3 Characters: Honkai 3 Complexity: Honkai 3 Plot twists: Honkai 3 Pretty cinge: Genshin Depth: Honkai 3 Philosophy: Honkai 3 Dialogues: Honkai 3 Consistency: Honkai 3 Dynamics: Honkai 3 Parallels: Honkai 3 Ending/Conclusion: Honkai 3 Honkai Impact 3rd slams\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n5\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\n### [@DeviousNut14](https://www.youtube.com/@DeviousNut14)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c&lc=Ugyoj5F1zOtAHhIixW14AaABAg)\\n\\nRegardless who's the best Mihoyo still win's ![Image 22: 💀](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c) \\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n255\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n7 replies\\n\\n7 replies\\n\\n![Image 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\n### [@neontricity](https://www.youtube.com/@neontricity)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c&lc=UgwBO5aZ0S3E6wOaNDN4AaABAg)\\n\\ncoming back from just finishing act V of sumeru, i can tell they are definitley improving. act V is quite long but i was rlly invested and didnt get bored at all.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n31\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\n### [@tidehunterzamora9315](https://www.youtube.com/@tidehunterzamora9315)\\n\\n[2 years ago (edited)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c&lc=UgyUrPzTdWqBd42EqlZ4AaABAg)\\n\\nWorld and Graphics: Genshin (Ofc Open World) End Game Content: Honkai (ER,Abyss/Superstring and Memorial while Genshin only have Spiral Abyss) Story: Honkai (Because of one thing they are not afraid to kill a Characters to progress the story unlike in Genshin Because of the profit and Community outraged) Gacha: both are worst (Genshin has one of the worst rate and 50/50 you need atleast 180 wish to get the guarantee specially in the weapons banner.

If more people don't like Genshin's story than they do Honkai's, that doesn't make Genshin's story bad, it just means that a majority of people just aren't into that plot type. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n15\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\nComments 1.5K\\n-------------\\n\\nTop comments\\n\\nNewest first\\n\\n![Image 33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\nDescription\\n-----------\\n\\nGenshin Impact Vs Honkai Impact [#shorts](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/shorts)\\n\\n57KLikes\\n\\n597,309Views\\n\\n2022Oct 28\\n\\n …\\n\\nTranscript\\n\\nFollow along using the transcript.\\n\\nShow transcript\\n\\n[![Image 34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c) ### Emergency Food 37K subscribers](https://www.youtube.com/@emergencyfood6565)\\n\\n[Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dObQsxY4b4dK-AzAlT1Mw/videos)\\n\\n[About](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dObQsxY4b4dK-AzAlT1Mw/about)\\n\\n[Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dObQsxY4b4dK-AzAlT1Mw/videos)[About](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dObQsxY4b4dK-AzAlT1Mw/about)\\n\\n![Image 35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5Aeot8R3c)\\n\\nTranscript\\n----------\\n\\nNaN / NaN\\n\\n[![Image 36](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxeoWrvPZk0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDGQgBFQAAiEIYAdgBAeIBCggYEAIYBjgBQAE=&rs=AOn4CLBP2C8nIm2zyDZ433U6W3tMVakNgQ) 15:31 15:31 Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxeoWrvPZk0)\\n\\n[### i played another weird genshin ripoff so you don't have to Gratis Gratis Verified • • 1.6M views 2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxeoWrvPZk0)\\n\\n[![Image 37](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kgk7mJbCNy8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDGQgBFQAAiEIYAdgBAeIBCggYEAIYBjgBQAE=&rs=AOn4CLAEGJAmAFY83j3QG4f4GLCHieo7HA) 12:32 12:32 Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgk7mJbCNy8)\\n\\n[### The ONLY F2P Characters YOU Should Invest In (Honkai: Star Rail Beginners Guide) wtfmikxy wtfmikxy • • 76K views 1 year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgk7mJbCNy8)\\n\\n[![Image 38](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xeu5mSXx_3A/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDGQgBFQAAiEIYAdgBAeIBCggYEAIYBjgBQAE=&rs=AOn4CLBBt-qMxMXUS16jMQtqh-Pp5z9RnA) 2:01 2:01 Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeu5mSXx_3A)\\n\\n[### Genshin Impact 5.7 Skirk Release News: Everything You Need to Know Paimon’s Bulletin Paimon’s Bulletin • • 28 views 23 hours ago New](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeu5mSXx_3A)\\n\\n[![Image 39](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDsWHvh5lwQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDGQgBFQAAiEIYAdgBAeIBCggYEAIYBjgBQAE=&rs=AOn4CLAn8VvsYjeAC5y93R6RgQgb_7gAvA) 5:20 5:20 Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDsWHvh5lwQ&pp=0gcJCYsJAYcqIYzv)\\n\\n[### Welt Talks about Kevin with Acheron (Cutscene) | Honkai Star Rail 2.1 Streetwise Rhapsody Streetwise Rhapsody Official Artist Channel • • 114K views 1 year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDsWHvh5lwQ&pp=0gcJCYsJAYcqIYzv)\\n\\n[![Image 40](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9cljPOOgC0Y/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCKgBEF5IWvKriqkDGQgBFQAAiEIYAdgBAeIBCggYEAIYBjgBQAE=&rs=AOn4CLAWEDeZemt94cJwlp8aybMdXdTZrw) 3:12 3:12 Now playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cljPOOgC0Y)\\n\\n[### Genshin characters with Honkai Style Burst!!

Your work is pulling the character, having a good 4-star weapon and grinding good artifacts. It’s far and away a more assessable F2P friendly game.\\n\\nStory and events it's a cake walk, and you can still get crystals from Abyss and Memorial Arena without going tryhard, but if you're going competitive, then like any other gatcha games, there's Powercreep.\\n\\nHonkai Impact on the other hand, the Abyss put players each other to see who can beat the boss faster and get a score, so the New Valkys always will be better than the oldest and you need to have your team updated. Of course that this only apply to the Red Lotus and Nirvana.\\n\\nIn terms of banners, Honkai Impact are \\\"slightly\\\" better than Genshin Impact because there are no 50/50 (in the context of getting S-tier Valky).\\n\\nAlso, Honkai Impact is less-friendly because you have to pull for the character AND the gear (Stigmata). Weapon pities do not carry over unlike Genshin Impact. Only the EXPA character banner in Honkai Impact has a pity that carries over.\\n\\n![Image 10](https://hyl-static-res-prod.hoyolab.com/divider_config/PC/line_1.png)\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\n*   **For casual players who just want to keep up with the story and events**, there is 0 incentive to spend money. It's entirely accessible for free with no difficulty spikes or gear checks.\\n*   **For completionists**, this game is a nightmare with the amount of time limited content. Not even a paycheck can save you.\\n*   **For competitive players**, biggest paycheck wins (with some strategic spending possible). That usually only applies to leaderboard based modes, which are completely optional.\\n*   **As a story driven player**, they only touch the gacha to get their favorites with no regard for meta, and the f2p income is sufficient for that.\\n*   **Pity** : Because of soft pity, pulling character in Genshin Impact mostly need about 70-ish. While on Honkai Impact, usually I need to reach hard pity (100th pull). That's true btw, I still remember exactly the moment I got Silver Wing Bronya. It took me 95 pulls in order to get her. Godness...\\n*   **Weapon** : On high level, Honkai Impact really needs Valky's signature weapon to be able to compete on the Memorial Arena or on the Abyss. On Genshin Impact, while it's good to have the signature weapon, you can use free weapons (forged weapons, Festering Desire, \\\"The Catch\\\", and any other limited-event weapons) or 4-star weapons (Favonius Weapon Series, The Flute, Stringless, etc.) and your character can still do massive damage. On top of that, weapon in Genshin Impact can be used by multiple character. Like Staff of Homa on Zhongli, Wolf's Gravestone on Razor, and Skyward Harp on Tartaglia.\\n\\n![Image 11](https://hyl-static-res-prod.hoyolab.com/divider_config/PC/line_1.png)\\n\\nWhat do you think?

For context I guess you could call me semi competitive in HI3 (red lotus-nirvana bouncing, usually top 2% MA, consistent finality clears in ER without too much sweat) and more casual in the other games (36\\\\* abyss once but typically don’t bother with floor 12, haven’t done MoC but have cleared up to floor 14 of forgotten hall and having no larger issues doing SU). Not having a 50/50 system makes the pity of HI3 100 with 1.5% rates for characters while the effective pity of the other games is 180 with 0.3% rates before 50/50 and 0.6% after for rate up characters. HI3 (in my experience) being more generous with gacha currency on top of this makes a 4/4 character in HI3 about as hard to get as just a character in the other games. Rank ups in HI3 are nowhere near as C/E 6 in the other games and on top of this does HSR characters seem decently reliant on lightcones.\\n\\n2023/06/13\\n\\nReply\\n\\n14\\n\\n[![Image 15](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png) [Goose~](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=108348972)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=108348972)\\n\\nThis makes GI’s and HSR’s only real saving grace a lack of meaningful endgame content as the games would be completely atrocious for f2p players if ranked content existed. As for the competitive parts of HI3, Pardofelis (farmable character) was a really good character in ER for over a year and could pretty much brute force every week. Not sure how she holds up after recent ER changes as I haven’t played with her much recently but I’m sure she’s still fine besides, other farmable characters as Susannah and PROMETHEUS still perform really well. For my level in abyss you need a decent number of different teams but before I was able to obtain those I retained agony 3 with 2 decent teams (not full gear and some more meta characters missing). MA is not really a priority as it gives fewer crystals but as you get better in abyss you’ll also get better there.\\n\\n2023/06/13\\n\\nReply\\n\\n7\\n\\n[![Image 16](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png) [Goose~](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=108348972)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=108348972)Comments [Goose~](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=108348972) : \\n\\nThe main reason I prefer HI3 is the ability to plan your pulls, every summer a very powerful S rank releases followed by a farmable S rank, in late winter/early spring another powerful S rank releases together with an S rank free from events and with a discount gear banner. Between these are other S rank releases (usually safe skips unless supports in which case they are top priority) and A ranks or SP releases (characters themselves are farmable but gear tends to be worth it to go for). This is, in my opinion, strongly preferable to GI where the only consistent release is archons a couple of patches after a new region and where 4\\\\* characters are only ever guaranteed through events. For other non archon 5\\\\* you’ll never know how good they are until after they release, they might be extremely good or a downgrade form the worst 4\\\\* in the game but whatever the case is they’re always gacha exclusive. HSR is too new to make a judgement but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the same.\\n\\n2023/06/13\\n\\nReply\\n\\n5\\n\\nReplies: 3\\n\\n[![Image 17](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=25461892)\\n\\n[TehMaddoctor](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=25461892)\\n\\n9F\\n\\nComparing Honkai Impact 3rd with Genshin Impact in terms of f2p requires a lot of comparisons. I get 13k crystals in hi3rd while I get 5k at most in Genshin (monthly) the difference is insane and I'm talking about max level end game\\n\\nGenshin pity is 80 but it's soft pity, I can't count how many times I lost 50/50 in Genshin. Honkai is 100 but it's guaranteed.\\n\\nLet's conpare item banners. Genshin has a terrible mechanic that requires 3x pity for guarantee and you don't even earn artifacts. With the same pulls to get a Genshin weapon you will get a full set of weapon plus stigmata in Honkai. Plus you don't need multiple weapon drops to upgrade them to max power in Honkai. Pri arm materials are free in comparison.\\n\\nHonkai gives S rankers for free in events and celebrations. Genshin gives 4 star characters and there are no specific 4 star banners.\\n\\nFinally the system of fragments means you progress much faster with every pull rather than wait for constallation drops\\n\\n \\n\\n2023/06/14\\n\\nReply\\n\\n8\\n\\n[![Image 18](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png) [WillowVines ![Image 19](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/small_img_loading_light.b48bd29.png)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=303235903)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=303235903)\\n\\nAre you sure?\\n\\nYou need 28 800 primogems to get a guaranteed character (but soft pity and winning the 50/50 exists).

Elysia is best example, you can only pull her weapon and the rest of it (character and stigmata sets) which can obtain her on shops (war treasury) and forged (foundry). All past Valkyrie can be underrated for survived player for lowest score from Dirac Sea/Superstring ( which Spiral Abyss type on Honkai Impact 3rd) and they're also farmable. Exchange shop is a good way to obtain the past weapon or stigmata piece by converting if you have duplicate weapon and/or stigmata piece, this way you can at least get piece set that people familiar with character ( HOR, HOT, HOV, Delta, vermilion knight, Stygian Nymph, Twilight paladin, etc) and some good support Stigmata piece.

You can argue that you only need 100 pulls to get the character, but in order to be competitive (redlotus minimum and semi-comfy ER), you got to at least have the weapon for dps. The higher you rank, the bigger crystal rewards you get. The bigger rewards you want, the more you have to invest in gear banner. Additionally, gear banner soft pity doesn't have any way to guarantee you duplicate uprate stigmatas. I would love to use the wishing well.. unfortunately I have had the most bad luck that I only get off-rate dupe stigs.

However, everyone here has seemed to state the obvious, so I won't make a long comparison between the two. Let's keep it simple.\\n\\n 90% of the stigmata in Honkai's foundary system that allows you to craft works on literally every character for the most part. Genshin on the other hand has either limited 4 star weapons from events that'll never come back around again or 5 star must pulls. I'm an end game player for both games and I can definitely say that Hi3 is far more F2p friendly as well as generous when it comes to its rewards.\\n\\n Not only do events have reruns, but they also bring back the things you've missed out on before in Hi3. In Genshin, especially if you were a new player just starting out, you won't be able to get those weapons ever again and they'll reward you with things that'll be decent enough for some stuff maybe...\\n\\n In Genshin, you'd technically have to farm wayy past 80 pulls.\\n\\n2023/06/15\\n\\nReply\\n\\n3\\n\\n[![Image 36](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png) [Mei\\\\_Kin](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=212777464)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=212777464)\\n\\nYou'd have to farm past 160 for a guaranteed if you're unlucky on the first pull + an extra 75-80 for the weapon and possibly more than that. A lot of dps characters are not functional at all with the free 2 play stuff and require certain weapons. This also applies to supports as well.\\n\\n In Honkai, you could farm up to 100 and on most banners literally do an extra 50 pulls for the full stigmata and weapon stuff. That's literally 150.\\n\\n When you compare 150 in Honkai vs over 300 sum pulls in Genshin, Honkai's clearly the more F2p. Most abyss would require you to have some archon or certain 5 star characters that'll take years to obtain.\\n\\n2023/06/15\\n\\nReply\\n\\n1\\n\\n[![Image 37](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png) [Mei\\\\_Kin](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=212777464)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=212777464)Comments [Byron\\\\_TQG](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=112571045) : \\n\\nWell actually— Not having either of Albedo's event weapons renders him back down to the usual 3 star and whenever people look up how to build characters nowadays, it'd be hard to accept the fact that you can't get those weapons anymore. Event weapons still count as F2p regardless. Also, there are actually a few 5 star weapons in Genshin that make the characters much more better than what they're originally are. It just seems to help when making runs in the abyss. Hence, I also stated that not all the F2p weapons will work for specific characters. Take the Prototype rancour for example... Who in their right mind would put that on someone like Kazuha or the even some of the 3 star bows. The slingshot is nice and all for its crit value but if we're talking weapon passives here then there are way more better options that either require events or Gacha. We're talking passives here and utility for the entire team or for the characters themselves...\\n\\n Unless you can explain to me otherwise\\n\\n2023/06/18\\n\\nReply\\n\\n0\\n\\nReplies: 5\\n\\n[![Image 38](https://www.hoyolab.com/_static/img/default_avatar.25aeebf.png)](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=42633368)\\n\\n[Hydra4040](https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter?id=42633368)\\n\\n14F\\n\\nHi\\n\\nI was thinking abt trying honkai impact 3rd, so can I with older units be able to clear content?

Like APHO 1/2 where they added air combat, there even some kind of 'elemental reaction' in APHO 2 and another new feat like mount enemies, white heat mode, combination attack etc...

Then you have the ability to forge workable (and even some top) weapons and stigmata if you can't get them in gacha. But even the gacha has fair guarantees via a more generous Pity count, as well as a full set of equipment having its own banner, with guarantees of getting all pieces. Some banners give fragments every 10 pulls, making it easier to rank Valks up and unlock further skills -- and the fact you can rank any unit up to make them more powerful is a big plus. As well as the ability to farm a lot of great SP units, many of which are considered top Support units and gamechanging. While a lot of effort goes into Genshin too, I feel like the Genshin team lets RNG determine way too much, and especially later on, that's going to be a big factor in how much players do or do not enjoy the game. Since it's impossible to get artifacts via the gacha, and the only way to get constellations (rank up) is the gacha, it's much harder for players to power up their units. The Genshin team did give players a way to exchange unwanted artifacts, but the cost to use this function, as well as the RNG, make it more worth it just to do more artifact runs. The overall greater randomness does not feel good, and has frustrated many people. The most demonstrative case of this is when Tectone originally went after the Staff of Homa. Back then, Pathing on the Weapons Banner was not a thing, so there were not any guarantees about which 5 star weapon a player would get. The Weapons Banner is still widely considered a scam, and unfriendly to Freeplayers and Limited Spenders, but back then, well... Tectone tried to get the Staff across multiple streams, since losing so many times hurt on an emotional and psychological level, even just to watch. In the end he spent $1,700 just to get a single Staff of Homa, and he still had to R5 it. Generally speaking, C6'ing a 5 star character is prohibitively expensive to Freeplayers and Limited Spenders, who would prefer to save their resources for new characters. It is satisfying to see big numbers while in combat, but there's a huge gap in general experience between Leviathans like Tectone who feel the game is too easy, and Freeplayers and Limited Spenders, who find Abyss to be challenging, sometimes just to complete, nevermind to 36 star. The latter group is left feeling undergeared because of RNG, and hoping PvP is never added to the game. Big spenders, meanwhile, are left bored and hoping for a challenge.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n129\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n2 replies\\n\\n2 replies\\n\\n![Image 23](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@jovelyndungog5366](https://m.youtube.com/@jovelyndungog5366)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=UgzkB3zIpnrjS020Nn94AaABAg)\\n\\nAs for the grinding part the thing that turns me off in genshin is artifact rng i wish it had a guarantee system sure you ccan get lucky and get good pieces within a week but what if you dont get lucky it might take longer than grinding honkais signature gearrs just for 1 character well good thing meta in genshin isnt that relevant than in honkai but if i can just clear abyss in genshin with the same old characters then whats the point of pulling for new ones\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n108\\n\\nDislike\\n\\n![Image 24](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n❤ by @Venessense\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 25](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n4 replies\\n\\n![Image 26](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n4 replies\\n\\n![Image 27](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@sparking023](https://m.youtube.com/@sparking023)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=Ugw9VUDlDQaHrfsmhwZ4AaABAg)\\n\\nHaving three years of Honkai under my belt and being a massive Devil May Cry fan, I naturally feel it is the most fun game, especially compared to Genshin. Don't get me wrong, Genshin is pretty aight and chain reactions sounds pretty fun, but man, I'm all about that flashy anime-esque combat. Just look at the collab between the two and how Keqing and Fischl play differently. And even though it is a pain to grind in honkai (eternally stuck in agony 2 T-T ) it is hella fun, and I can feel the learning curve progress when I sort of memorize the combo sequences, the timed evasions, the synergies and such. It's pretty intuitive and every battlesuit feels unique in some way. APHO 2 brings all of those points to the next level with aerial combat too, so there's that\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n52\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n3 replies\\n\\n3 replies\\n\\n![Image 28](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@tankadamka](https://m.youtube.com/@tankadamka)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=UgzftiyfNxZANr9cXdx4AaABAg)\\n\\nAs a player of both, Honkai has more fast paced action, even rather darker story including self-understanding of the characters and gear is more character-specific but easier to get (plus I got my luckiest pulls here.

In honkai , stigmatas of 1 Valkyrie can be used for others depends on each situations . for example: liliya(ice sp) can use raven's stigmatas and give better results than raven in MA(liliya ult cost only 25sp to trigger the stigmata set effect and raven ult cost 100sp) .\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n21\\n\\nDislike\\n\\n![Image 37](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n❤ by @Venessense\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 38](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n2 replies\\n\\n![Image 39](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n2 replies\\n\\n![Image 40](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@bravo9960](https://m.youtube.com/@bravo9960)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=UgwhHdyJ1cf7W_5ijZN4AaABAg&pp=0gcJCSMANpG00pGi)\\n\\nsince Genshin is mostly about Elemental Reaction, I want Kallen in genshin\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n19\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n3 replies\\n\\n3 replies\\n\\n![Image 41](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@raibyo](https://m.youtube.com/@raibyo)\\n\\n[2 years ago (edited)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=Ugy_jsvT3HlKso6Bv2V4AaABAg)\\n\\nI don't play Genshin much so I can only say for Honkai side. In Honkai, certain characters, especially main dps are very much set with their own equipment that mismatching equipments would only make them worse, while a lot of the support characters are made to be mismatched. Like how Pardofelis is an ice support bout some she end up being able to support other elements depending on the stigma and like how Divine Prayer can switch between physical and lightning support depending on the equipment. There's also the Fu Hua Margrave set which is good for pretty much all elemental supports. While the main dps are set with their equipment, once in a while, intentionally or unintentionally, the new equipment introduced end up being better than their old signatures, like how Eden's stigma is better for HoT than HoT's signature set Banaras, and like how Elysia's stigma set being useful for pretty much all physical dps valks, and like how Ana Schariac set is best for most Ice dps. And back a few years, Monet set was best lightning set and then they introduced Goemon set. mixing up those two sets actually ended up being better than set effects of both of the sets alone, so much that it ended up changing the game meta for a while. Even now Monet and Goemin mix is still the standard go to set for lightning dps if you don't have the signature set. There's also the fact that the two Fu Huas, HoS and AE will pretty much always be in meta, from what we have seen. You will see AE as a support on most elemental teams and HoS pretty much is the most essential physical support. Also, another thing Honkai have over Genshin is that because of the way the game and characters are structured, you get different versions of the same character in Honkai while you only get one version of each character in Genshin. I know a bunch of people who would die to get Raiden Shogun boss as a playable character but since there's already a playable Raiden Shogun, it is unlikely. Like, in Honkai, even if the character you liked in story ended up having a gameplay style you don't like, you can still expect a future version of that character which have a gameplay style that suits you more. Same can't be said for Genshin. But who knows. Time will tell. Maybe they'll end up adding a different version of the characters that already exists or a system similar to the augment system from Honkai. For me, the biggest thing Honkai have over Genshin would be not related to any of the stuff I mentioned above, but rather, a basic and essential control and gameplay element that makes a lot of difference, that is, not requiring to manually switch between Keyboard and controller. That's a big problem Genshin have. It's not that much of a problem for Mobile players since they don't have the problem in the first place and Play Station players should be used to that but it is a big problem for PC players. In Genshin, if you want to use the controller, you end up sacrificing the use of mouse which is stuck to Keyboard mode. Honkai on the other hand let you use both without needing to switch through. The mouse and the keyboard remains entirely functional while you're playing with the controller and switching only requires you to drop the controller and grab the mouse. If Genshin have the same function, a lot of stuff would be made a lot easier. Imagine if you're using a bow character while using the controller and you can simply just switch to mouse immediately when you want to aim. The main gameplay of Genshin is pretty much made for controller, but there are a lot of stuff the benefits from being able to use the mouse and keyboard and the problem is, we are stuck with choosing one or the other and not both. Maybe we should be able to persuade enough people in the playerbase to ask for it in future surveys? If enough people ask for it, they might just add it.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n9\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 42](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@anonymousfox5005](https://m.youtube.com/@anonymousfox5005)\\n\\n[2 years ago (edited)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=Ugza0jdsi5yuN9NMdEh4AaABAg&pp=0gcJCSMANpG00pGi)\\n\\nA very nice and in-depth explanation of the combat system. I like the summary of it all. Some people would argue that artifacts are free to get but harder to achieve what stats you specifically want while in Honkai, you could craft stigmatas but ultimately specific stigmatas for each characters feels best which most of the time are gacha-locked. Though I would say that the only specific stigmatas are more required for dps characters, while supplementing support characters with craftable stigmata are absolutely fine. In which case, Genshin is a lot more of a hassle to build so I agree with your statement.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n9\\n\\nDislike\\n\\n![Image 43](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n❤ by @Venessense\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 44](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n7 replies\\n\\n![Image 45](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n·\\n\\n7 replies\\n\\n![Image 46](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@potatom2765](https://m.youtube.com/@potatom2765)\\n\\n[2 years ago (edited)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=Ugy4PsNjPJy7u9YFaMt4AaABAg&pp=0gcJCSMANpG00pGi)\\n\\nI just love the universal marage (idk how to spell).

Artifact grinding and grinding for valk frags arent all too different on average, main diff being that u could get lucky in genshins on 1 run or be unlucky and never get it even after hundreds while in Honkai its guaranteed to get the frags of sp valks and some other non-sp ones. But the main thing that sells me on Honkai over Genshin is that in honkai, most characters have unique mechanics and playstyles whereas in Genshin everything goes back to the one system\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n3\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 53](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@soksocks](https://m.youtube.com/@soksocks)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=Ugyo5Ogeykog7cnFrDl4AaABAg)\\n\\nIt's my biased but Honkai. Played it back in freshman-sophmore year of high school of its day 1 release and one of the only mobile games, at the time, I could tolerate up to now. I pretty much grew with the game and kept on going. For genshin though, I don't want to downplay it. Reason being is that it's still a growing game, it's not the likes of Honkai yet. I did play genshin day 1 also, it felt familiar(as some might say like BoTW). Played it up to when Klee dropped, so anything foward idk at all. Both games aren't really comparable due to being different genres basically. So things may seemed dialed down from Honkai into Genshin, but that's mainly gameplay decisions. Overall it's up to those deciding what to play or really those who have started out on. Like me, I started with Honkai and will definitely choose it over Genshin any day. For those who play Genshin and never touched Honkai, I can totally understand why you play the game for whatever reason then maybe later on get into Honkai. A lot of possibilities but anything can go\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n3\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 54](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\n### [@Pure\\\\_Random](https://m.youtube.com/@Pure_Random)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE&lc=UgzyGAAQF89hGFHdL6B4AaABAg&pp=0gcJCSMANpG00pGi)\\n\\nCan't say I prefer one combat dynamics over the other but for me personally the world and exploration/interaction are as important as the combat gameplay, so genshin wins by a mile here.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\nLike\\n\\n1\\n\\nDislike\\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 55](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\nComments 108\\n------------\\n\\nTop comments\\n\\nNewest first\\n\\n![Image 56](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO-fphe2fE)\\n\\nDescription\\n-----------\\n\\nGenshin VS Honkai: Gameplay\\n\\n804Likes\\n\\n27,156Views\\n\\n2022Jun 24\\n\\nLast time we took a look at storytelling of both Genshin and Honkai Impact and came to a conclusion that Honkai is tell their story in a bit more of a Cohesive manner.

It first made headlines when a petition signed by 1000 Japanese residents made headlines worldwide. The petition — spearheaded Taichi Takashita was addressed to their government. This request is to grant and establish a law that would allow them to marry comic characters, says the UK’s Daily Telegraph on October 30, 2008. Although the Japanese government did not pay attention to the request, the petition served as the foundation to waifuism, which pertains to a fandom or a community in love or obsessed with comic or fictional characters.\\n\\nAs much as we want to dive more into Waifuism, that is a topic for another day. Today, however, we will take a quick look at two of the best free-to-play games that feature the baddest waifu material on the planet. Let’s see that in both the Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd game.\\n\\nDo take note that our focus will be on the game features and not on the characters since all of them are already waifu materials. The purpose of making the gameplay mechanics the focus is to provide an overview of which game suits your playstyle better. With that said, check out our brief comparison between two of miHoYo’s biggest titles.\\n\\nGraphics\\n--------\\n\\nGenshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd come from the same developer, which means that there isn’t much to compare to graphics. Nevertheless, Genshin Impact is the newer title with a substantial budget looks. It feels like an evolved version of Honkai Impact 3rd. It features better physics and more details to both characters and environment. In other words, the waifus in Genshin Impact is more detailed compared to its cousin game.\\n\\n![Image 1: Genshin Impact](https://games.lol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Genshin-Impact.jpg)\\n\\nWeapons\\n-------\\n\\nThe gameplay is where Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd differ. Genshin Impact is more on fewer explosives or weapons that do not employ the use of gunpowder for starters. The game features four types of weapon (Bow, Claymore, Polearm, Sword) and an element based item called a catalyst. Honkai Impact 3rd, on the other hand, features a diverse arsenal of weapons made up of cannons, crosses, gauntlets, greatswords, katana, lance, Pistols, and scythes. In a nutshell, if you are one of those players who like a wide selection of weapons in their game then, Honkai Impact 3rd is the game for you.\\n\\n![Image 2: Mihoyo Waifus](https://games.lol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mihoyo-Waifus.jpg)\\n\\nEnvironment\\n-----------\\n\\nThe environment is another element that makes Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd unique from each other. For starters, Genshin Impact features an open-world map that players can explore for hours on end. The massive plan features a plethora of characters, loot, and secret locations. Honkai Impact 3rd, on the other hand, does not feature an open-world environment, only a semi-open arena during battles. With that said, if you like open-world exploration with your waifu, then Genshin Impact is the game for you. Otherwise, the episodic arena of Genshin Impact 3rd is going to be your next option if you don’t like exploration.\\n\\n![Image 3: Waifu Gameplay Environment](https://games.lol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Waifu-Gameplay-Environment.jpg)\\n\\nOverall Gameplay\\n----------------\\n\\nWhen it comes to the overall gameplay, both Genshin Impact, and Honkai Impact 3rd feature fast-paced, action-packed battles. For the most part, between the two titles, Genshin Impact is the one that features the most content with less monetization. The awe-inspiring open-world gameplay, the brilliant soundtrack, and the highly detailed artwork provide the perfect setting for the plethora of quests, missions, and activities. Honkai Impact 3rd, on the other hand, is more on the jaw-dropping battles packed with special effects.\\n\\nAs to which one is better depends entirely on your gaming preferences. If you want straightforward, fast-paced battles, then Honkai Impact is for you. However, if you prefer an open-world ARPG action, then, Genshin Impact is the best game available to date.\\n\\n![Image 4: Spending time with waifu](https://games.lol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Spending-time-with-waifu.png)\\n\\nSpending Quality Time with Your Waifu\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nGenshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd both feature some of the deadliest, captivating, and powerful waifu characters in free-to-play gaming. However, when it comes to choices, Genshin Impact’s 23 characters tower over the 14 characters of Honkai Impact 3rd. If you are into waifuism, then the question as to which is the better game lies in your personal bias or interest. However, if you like a specific waifu from one of miHoYo’s fun, not all the elements mentioned above will matter.\\n\\nBesides, you will probably play the game to be with your better half. To that end, if you want an action-packed game that you can play on your PC, with waifu or not, both Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd have got you covered.\\n\"\n    }\n]"
